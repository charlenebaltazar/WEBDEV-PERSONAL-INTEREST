I was tasked on how to style text, and how to style and manipulate the boxes that content sits inside.
In including setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. 
I round off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links. 
Looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS grid, and positioning style, clolor,
